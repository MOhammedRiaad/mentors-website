## Description:

- **Codehood Mentors** is a free mentorship platform - in the development process - for *Arabic* speaking coders. It is meant to a hub for Arab learners who find it difficult to start because of the language barriers, and those who prefer to get explanations in their mother language together with volunteering mentors who want to give back to their community.

- Mentees can search for mentors have good experiences with specific technologies, and mentors from specific Arab countries (in case they find it more comfortable to work with people from their countries or certain countries).

- Mentors are volunteers who accept assigning some flexible time - according to their personal schedule - to teach, technically, and professional support learners, and answer their questions. It is all up to mentors regarding the amount of flexible time they can volunteer, and the number of people they can support.
